# denoiser-realtime-48k-ios
The project is a real-time processing of noise reduction at a 48K sampling rate

## Features of the project
* The real-time noise reduction of DeepFilterNet is realized by c++
* Only partial acceleration has been achieved, still in the process of further optimization
* Do not rely on any third party
* At present, Demo is only implemented on iOS, and the whole noise reduction is cross-platform
